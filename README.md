# surfs_up

## Overview 

The purpose of this project is to analyze the weather of Oahu, Hawaii in order to determine if a surf shop business will be sustainable year round before opening a shop in this location. 

## Results 

A summary analysis of Oahu weather resulted in these statistics for June:

And these statistics for December:

The key differences include: 
- There are about 200 less data points for December despite having similar number of days in the month. 
- The average temperature in June is only about 3 degrees less than the average temperature for the month of June. 
- There is an 8 degree difference between the minimum temperatures recorded, but there is only a 2 degree difference between the maximum temperatures recorded. 

## Summary

Comparing June and December temperatures in Oahu to represent Summer and Winter months show that the location is largely a temperate climate with temperatures largely ranging between the 50s and 80s all year round. In order to further evaluate the validity of this location for opening a surf shop, I would recommend analyzing rain fall amounts in both months in addition to average wind speed. These metrics should give some insight into whether this location has sustainable surfing conditions.
